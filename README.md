# GPR_Note

Very simple Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm is written in `common/homemade_GPR.py`. The usage of the homemad GPR is in the codes, `Poject1`. Also, homemade Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is coded in `common/homemad_BO.py`. Comination of two homemade implementation is in `Projcet2`.

GPR of scikit-learn and its combination to BO are placed in `Project3` and `Project4`. The interface for our purpose is in `common/SKL_GPR.py`.

BO is also provided by another code, BayesiaonOptimizaiton. DEMO with the same example is written in `Project5`.

# Requirements 
 
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn: for sklearn.gaussian_process for `Project3` and `Project4`
* BayesianOptimization for `Project5`
