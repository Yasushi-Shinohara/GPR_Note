# GPR_Note

Very simple Gaussian process regression (GPR) algorithm is written in the codes, `Poject1`. The code is applied to Bayesian optimization (BO) as well with very simple acquistion functions, `Project2`.
GPR with scikit-learn implementation is also given in `Project3` directory and the combination to BO in `Prject4`.
